    <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/evhart/crees">Crisis Event Extraction Service (CREES)</a> provides a rest API for annotating short text documents for helping to classify large amount of short document (e.g. tweets) by 1) identifying if a document is related to a crisis event (e.g., fire, earthquake); 2) the type of event discussed and, 3) the type of information present in a document. This add-on makes such API available through custom functions.        
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://evhart.github.io/crees/">CREES add-on</a> provides three different customs functions that can be applied on textual columns or individual cells for annotating the contained text. Each cell should contain a small document similar in length to tweets.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CREES add-on makes available the following functions: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>CREES_RELATED:</b> Identifies if a short text document discusses a crisis event (returns one of the following labels: <i>non-related, related</i>).</li>
        <li><b>CREES_EVENT:</b> Identifies the type of event discussed within a short textual document (returns one of the following labels: <i>bombings, collapse, crash, derailment, earthquake, explosion, fire, floods, haze, meteorite, none, shootings, typhoon, wildfire</i>).</li> 
        <li><b>CREES_INFO:</b> Identifies the type of information discussed within a short textual crisis-related document (returns one of the following labels: <i>affected_individuals, caution_and_advice, donations_and_volunteering, infrastructure_and_utilities, not_applicable, not_labeled, other_useful_information, sympathy_and_support</i>).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        More information about each function can be obtained  in the built-in documentation. You can access it by typing its the function name in a spreadsheet cell.
